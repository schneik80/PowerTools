# PowerTools Assembly - Component Warning.
#
# A passive guard that watches for feature-creation commands (sketches, solids,
# work geometry, patterns, surfaces, ...) and warns the user when the feature
# would land somewhere other than an appropriate component:
#
#   * directly in the root component (i.e. "no component at all"),
#   * in a non-leaf component (optional, off by default), or
#   * while a selection references a different component than the one being
#     edited.
#
# The guard toggle lives in the "PowerTools Settings" flyout of the QAT File menu
# as a regular button whose label flips between "Enable Component Warning" and
# "Disable Component Warning". While enabled and while the
# Design (Solid) workspace is active, it listens to ui.commandStarting and pops
# a modal warning before the offending command runs. The warning lets the user
# create the feature anyway, cancel it, or silence the warning for the active
# document.
#
# Behaviour is inspired by Thomas Axelsson's MIT-licensed "NoComponentWarn"
# Fusion 360 add-in; this is an independent reimplementation that follows the
# PowerTools command/handler conventions.
